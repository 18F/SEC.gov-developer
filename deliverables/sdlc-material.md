### Background




### Current State

Catching up with a private sector that has widely embraced web services, the federal government has seen several recent initiatives urging agencies to build and scale out API programs.  With 2012's [Digital Government Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html) and the 2013 [Open Data Policy](https://project-open-data.cio.gov) as encouragement, agencies are beginning to expose information as web services that developers can dynamically query.
